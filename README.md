## Overview
Catch The Ball is a simple and engaging game built using Python and Tkinter. The goal is to catch the falling ball using the paddle and score as high as possible before losing all lives. As the score increases, the ball speeds up and the paddle size decreases, making the game more challenging.

## Features

- Increasing difficulty as the score increases
- Simple and clean UI with a dark theme
- Restart option after game over
